**Task:** Analyze the provided excerpt from a pathology report to determine if the specified condition is referenced in a historical context or as part of the current evaluation.


**Instructions:**

1. **Examine the Excerpt:**
   - Read the provided excerpt carefully, focusing on the mentions of the specified condition.

2. **Identify Mentions:**
   - List all instances in the excerpt where the specified condition appears.

3. **Determine Context:**
   - For each mention of the condition, assess whether it refers to:
     - **Current:** Findings or diagnoses directly related to the present evaluation or test results.
     - **Historical:** References to past diagnoses, treatments, or findings that provide background context and do not pertain to the current evaluation.

4. **Chain-of-Thought Analysis:**
   - For each mention, explain your reasoning by following these steps:
     1. **Contextual Analysis:** Summarize relevant surrounding text for each mention.
     2. **Comparison:** Identify keywords or phrases that denote current or historical context (e.g., "previously diagnosed," "currently," "at this time," "history of").
     3. **Conclusion:** Classify each mention as **AssertionCategory.PRESENT** or **AssertionCategory.HISTORICAL**.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Return an `AssertionResponse` with:
     - **Reasoning:** A clear justification based on your analysis.
     - **Assertion:** The final classification as either **AssertionCategory.PRESENT** or **AssertionCategory.HISTORICAL**.

### Example Input for Practice:

1. **Input Pair:**
   - **Excerpt:** 
   ```
   Clinical Information: Pap Smear, Conventional Received one fixed slide intact. LMP 12-OCT-23/03-OCT-23. History of LEEP x2 HSIL Pap 06-OCT-23/03-OCT-23 outside clinic Colpo with acetowhite (illegible) Hormonal contraception. Adequacy Assessment: Satisfactory for evaluation; transformation zone component present. Partially obscuring blood and inflammation present. Interpretation: Negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy. Reactive cellular changes associated with inflammation. Screened By: EN/RD,OD Completed By: Odile David, MD (Electronically Signed) 18-NOV-23/18-OCT-06. Comment: This specimen was reviewed as part of our internal quality assurance program. Note: The pap smear is not a diagnostic test. It is a screening test with an inherent false-negative rate in the range of 5-10%. Annual pap smears are the best means available to lower this false negative rate and to detect early cervical cancer. Please share this information with your patient.
   ```
   - **Condition:** HSIL

   **Expected Output:**
   ```json
   {{
     "reasoning": "The excerpt mentions a 'History of LEEP x2 HSIL' which indicates previous surgeries related to the condition HSIL. This is a reference to past interventions and does not pertain to current findings.",
     "assertion": "historical"
   }}
   ```

2. **Input Pair:**
   - **Excerpt:**
   ```
   Clinical Information: Pap Smear reveals abnormalities consistent with LSIL; further evaluation is required. LMP 12-OCT-23.
   ```
   - **Condition:** LSIL

   **Expected Output:**
   ```json
   {{
     "reasoning": "The excerpt indicates that the current pap smear shows findings 'consistent with LSIL'. This reflects present observations requiring follow-up.",
     "assertion": "present"
   }}
   ```


**Input:**
- **Excerpt:** {excerpt}
- **Condition:** {condition}
