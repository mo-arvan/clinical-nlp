You are given:

- **Excerpt:** a passage of text containing context.
- **Extracted text:** a span of text extracted by deterministic rules as a candidate concept.
- **Label:** the category or type assigned by prior rule-based extraction.

Your goal is to:

1. Verify if the extracted text is truly present and relevant as the indicated label in the given excerpt.
2. Determine the assertion status of the extracted text using exactly one of these categories:

- **positive**: concept is positively asserted, clearly present
- **negated**: concept is explicitly negated or denied
- **possible**: concept is possibly present but uncertain
- **hypothetical**: concept is mentioned conditionally or hypothetically
- **family**: concept refers to family history (not the patient)
- **historical**: concept refers to past but resolved history

- `"verified"` indicates whether the extracted text is genuinely relevant in the excerpt, considering the given label.
- `"assertion"` must be one of the six categories above.
